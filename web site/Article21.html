    Apple just held their big event in September and released several products and subscription service. It became their routine to release new iPhone on September. So everyone knew that the new iPhone will be released. Also, there were lots of rumers round and most of them are seems right. </p>
    <p>Here is a video of
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rAeqN-Q7x4" target="_blank"> Apple's September event</a>
    <p>In fact, it kind of getting bored watching Apple's event these days. We do not have a those excitment about new product as before. This becasue that there are lots of rumers around in beforehands and they have a pretty good resource behind.</p>
    <p>Anyway, Apple released quite amount of new things include hard divice and subscription service.
    <img src="https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/iphone11-select-2019-family?wid=882&amp;hei=1058&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=80&amp;op_usm=0.5,0.5&amp;.v=1567022175704" alt="Apple.com" align="left" width="20%" height="20%">
    First, they released iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max. Yes, now there is a pro version of iPhone. I feel like these divices are mainly focused on updating camera and battery life. So, not quite big jump from last iPhones. But their camera quarity seems very high and you can do various different thing with it. As they released new iPhone models, they remove some iPhone from and reduced price of some other iPhone. 
    <p>In this event, their new subscription service was one of the main thing. Arcade which is gaming subscrption service and Apple TV plus which is streaming service like Netflix.</p>
        
    <p>Oh here is my favorit one. The new iPad which you can use a Apple pencil with. By this point you can use Apple pencil with most of current iPad mnodel which is pretty cool. Also, price is quite reasonable.

    </p>
    <p>In this event, they released several products and service that are reasonable price. Compare to before Apple is appears to be targgeting more wider range of custmores. We cannot tell which products you should buy or not but will review them soon as we get them.</p>
