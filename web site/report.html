    <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: When I thought about topic for this wenb-site I wanted to something related to me. So, I came up with topical magazine with computer science and IT. It is very related to me and oen of my favorit topic read in other web-site. I found open source template for part of my web-site, but other than I created by myself. I used grid system to for structure because I was familir with it from last course work. I also used other type strcutre for simple pages.</p>
    
    <p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</strong>: Three things that insipired me is .... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple.com</li>
            <li>Boottrap's web desing example <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/blog/#">link</a></li>
            <li>MIT Technology review</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> I was inspier by Apple's website with it's very simple design. Also, I found that one web-site example from bootstrap web-site. I did not use any code from it but I was inpired with its design. MIT Technology review insoired me with its topic. It is IT focused web magazine by very farmous school in US. I thought that web-site has very good contents so I decided to create web-site magazine with computer science related topics.</p>
        
    <p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</strong>: My site accessible with its very clear navigation links in two locations within a page: header and footer. Also, sticky header on top of page gives a user to easy access to other pages. Finally, footer contains information that most of users would look for: publisher's information. Overall, my site has easy access to all information or funtion that user will look for while their visit. </p>
        
    <p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site </strong>: I consider use of J-Query increase usability in developer side. Also, use of Bootstrao increase usability in developer side. With bootstrtap you can work with less code. </p>
  
    <p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong>: Througout the process of creating this page, I learned several different things. First, I learned little bit of J-Query whiuch is a JavaScript libraly. I wanted to make a single HTML file for header or footer so I can have same exact header and footer in every pages. I don't need J-Query and header/footer HTML file to do that, but with J-Query it eaier to edit. I learne it by search on the Internet and I found very good YouTube video that describe about it. Secondly, I learned bootstrap, CSS and HTML a lot. Even though those two are covered on lectures, I needed to actually use them. This coursework was very good opotunity for that. I look back at lecture and W3school web site which was provided throug web development module. Finally, I found that the Internet searching skill is very iumportant to code. I knew that before but I did not from my heart. I needed to search lots of things throughout this coursework even very small things such as HTML tags. I learned it by actually experienced it through out this coursework.</p>
        
    <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong>: Overall, I was able to adapt a code from open source. I could messed up a strucutre when I edit it, but I look through very carfully to understand what part of code does what. I also think that my header and footer worked very well with J-Query. It is redandant to have long code of header and footer for each page, and it is hard to edit them correctly every time I made achange. With what I didm I was able to edit header and footer at one place for everypages. It was important because I did edit them a lot. </p>
        
    <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong>: Personally, I am not happy with desing of home page of this web-site. Just because I am not experienced enough with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web design, I was not able to create good design. I would do more research and spend more time to think about design of home page, becasue it is very important part of web-site.</p>
        
    <p><strong>Appendices</strong>: Wireframes, Mockups, and site map are in different file with PDF/PowerPoint format within assets folder.</p>
        
    <p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work? </strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>w3School HTML/CSS/Bootstrap</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDFxEALe0JA">YouTube video about J-Query</a></li>
