    <b><i>F</i><u>rom April of 2019:</u></b> University of London is now offering distance learning degree course BSc Computer Science.This degree developed to several different focused courses. Also, this is their first time to use Coursera, a online learning platform, as their learning platform for degree study. Computer science is the one of the raising degree to study in these days. Is this program will sucess or fail ? We dig into some detail.
    You can find much more detail from their <a href="https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science" target="_blank">web page</a> of this program</p>
    <p><br>First of all, this program is fully distance learning. So studdent can study this program in anywhere in the world. However, you need to go to ceratin location to take a exams. They have several exam center all over the world. Only downside is that examanisation fee might differe in different location. From some research I found that the exam center in US typically cost about &pound;20 to &pound;30 per ecam, but in Japan it cost about &pound;300 per exam. Unfortunatally, there are nothing that UoL can do about it..... </p>
    <p><br>In terms of cost, UoL offere very small fee compare to other schools in London. They offer <b>&pound;600/module</b>. I think it is very generous. Ususally you have pay more fee for BS program.</p>
    <p><br>UoL has a long history of providing distance learning program all over the world. But this is first time for them to use Cousera for learning platform. It is for sure that they might face some challenges over the period of the time. Will see how first semester goes! We are planning to interview couple students after a semester is ended. Stay turn for that.</p>
